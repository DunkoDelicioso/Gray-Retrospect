Quentin Holsmith - De Loraine Invictus from UCLA dept of literature has advocated for a rejection of anything labeled as “truth”. He asserts the future should be an “experiential battleground of stimulation... truth should only exist in the faith we collectively project” (PlsTf, 2016, otc). Surely this essay will garner skepticism as one of the “overtly confident” tabloids with a social agenda, but my aim is not to confuse - rather I am picking a past based on preference. My aim is to persuade you to choose this past with me, lest we lose ourselves in the thicket. (ELAN AMEN TARO: LTD< Cpm 4309910)
