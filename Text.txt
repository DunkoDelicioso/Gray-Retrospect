Dr. Zizmor is a New York Based plastic surgeon, more famous for his gaudy advertisements than his facial reconstructions. His banners, which lined the New York Subway system seemed as if they were designed to sell used cars - he was more of a “Crazy Eddie” than a trusted physician. It was difficult to imagine that his practice was authentic and because of this any factual details about his life seemed like grounds for debate. This complicated matters when he passed in late June of 2019.  Zizmor was one of the first to die from a rare condition known as Gristedes Panorama (the MRI data of his swelling brain has become a staple in medical textbooks across the US - FIGURE 1). This bacterial infection dehydrates synaptic tissue at an alarming rate, annually affecting ~0.0034% of the US population. This disease was unimportant and relatively treatable - but because it was Zizmor who had died the disease attracted attention from all the wrong places.Zizmor’s minor celebrity tainted media reports on the disease with a kind of unreality, and perhaps because of this conspiracy theorists were quick to swarm the airwaves with outlandish hypotheses. Some asserted the disease itself was fictitious while others exclaimed that it was a government tool to sterilize the poor.
