Fabricated Scientific data became indistinguishable from the real reports which poured in regularly now that the disease was in “vogue”. Fischer Books Ltd. had to recall the first edition of an Epidemiology textbook after finding that it had mistakenly included fake images created on an optometrists desktop computer (FIG 2). Social Media sites had a hard time parsing the truth and resorted to permanantly banning any discussion on the disease. Historians have lost track of which assertions about the illness are accurate, and have cited this instance as “the first gray retrospect.”(ESBLT, 2020, etca).  Public attention shifted leaving the past a disconnected mess. Of course we now take this level of ambiguity for granted - but at the time it was a culture shock to see how truth and lies could evaporate into something so ugly.
